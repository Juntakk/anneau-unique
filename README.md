# 🏰 Anneau Unique — A Fellowship's Digital Chronicle

> _"In the twilight of the Third Age, five brave souls heed the call of adventure. Their tales deserve to be etched not just in memory... but in code."_

## ✨ The Vision

**Anneau Unique** is a handcrafted digital companion built for an ongoing **Dungeons & Dragons** campaign, inspired by **The One Ring** RPG and Tolkien’s world.  
It is designed exclusively for me and my fellowship of companions to:

- Track character progression
- Manage weapons and equipment
- Chronicle fellowship roles and traits
- Edit values dynamically during sessions
- Preserve the memory of each journey taken

## 🧙 Who Is It For?

This project is not a public tool or a SaaS product.  
It is a personal passion project, forged for **five players** — each embodying a unique hero in our campaign of honor, shadow, and hope.

We use this during gameplay to:

- View and update character stats
- Manage roleplay data like traits and vocations
- Log weapon upgrades and earned rewards
- Serve as a living record of our saga

## ⚔️ Technologies Used

Like any great artifact, it’s built with care and modern magic:

- **Next.js 14 (App Router)** – the foundation of our interface
- **TypeScript** – for type-safe wizardry
- **Tailwind CSS** – for styling scrolls and swords alike
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL** – to persist every legend
- **Vercel** – the cloud kingdom that hosts it all

## 🔮 Final Words

> _"There is a seed of greatness in every adventurer. This app is but the soil that nurtures it."_

This project is a labor of love — a tribute to roleplay, friendship, and shared storytelling.

May it serve us well in the shadows of Angmar and the halls of Erebor.

> Built by Nick, keeper of the code and first of his name.
